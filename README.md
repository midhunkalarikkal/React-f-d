# 🍽️ CraveRoute - A Simple Food Ordering Application

CraveRoute is a simple and elegant food delivery application built as part of my learning journey with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. This project helped me explore and implement various concepts and features of React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS, combining them into a fully functional and responsive sample application.

Developed entirely from scratch, CraveRoute reflects my dedication to learning React and building modern web applications. By starting from a blank canvas, I structured the application logic, explored component-based development, and created a seamless user experience.

Although it is a basic project, with data stored only in **localStorage**, CraveRoute served as an excellent platform for me to dive deeper into React's capabilities and styling with Tailwind, while understanding how state management with Redux can simplify complex UI logic. Inspired by popular food delivery apps, it showcases essential features like restaurant listings, menu viewing, cart management, and a payment gateway.
